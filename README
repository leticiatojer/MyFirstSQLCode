Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree - SQL Project 
Completed in February 2020.

In this project, I queried the Chinook Database, which holds information about a music store. The objective of this project was to assist the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. I was provided with the database ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) and the database.

I was allowed to define 4 different questions that could be answered by querying the database. My final submission consisted of a PDF file containing visuals to illustrate my answers and a txt file with my SQL queries.
